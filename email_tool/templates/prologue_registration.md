Hi {{username}},

You've been registered for the **NorCal Hike & Fly Prologue**!

The prologue starts tomorrow and ends on the 31st of March. It looks like we'll have great weather for the opening day!


Reminder of the rule changes:

* Only a pilot’s top two scores will contribute to their total score
* Only one winner will be crowned. Divisions will exist but not be used.
* (NEW) Due to limited registration, the fly-with-friends bonus will not be used. 

Scoring will open tomorrow morning. To submit a tracklog, visit the [scoring page](https://norcalhf.com.com) and use these credentials:

|---|---|
| **Username** | {{username}} |
| **Passphrase** | {{passphrase}} |
| **Division** | {{category}} |

Good luck, have fun, and be safe!

— Rob
