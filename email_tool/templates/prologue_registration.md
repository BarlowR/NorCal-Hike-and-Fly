Hi {{username}},

You've been registered for the **NorCal Hike & Fly Prologue** in the {{category}} division!

The prologue starts tomorrow and ends on the 31st of March. It looks like we'll have great weather for the opening day!

I'm in the process of adding everyone to a telegram group. If you notice any problems with the website or the scoring system, please send an email to norcalhf@gmail.com or post there. 

Reminder of the rule changes:

* Only a pilot’s top two scores will contribute to their total score
* Only one winner will be crowned. Divisions exist but will not be used.
* (NEW) Due to limited registration, the fly-with-friends bonus will not be used. 

Scoring will open tomorrow morning. To submit a tracklog, visit the [scoring page on the website](https://norcalhf.com) and use these credentials:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Username** | {{username}} |
| **Passphrase** | {{passphrase}} |

Good luck, have fun, and be safe! Hope to see you on the ground and in the sky.

— Rob
