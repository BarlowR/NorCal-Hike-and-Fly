#### The Prologue will run from March 1st to March 31st. 

The Prologue is intended to give folks time to try out the scoring system before the full season begins. It is also an opportunity to see what infrastructure breaks.


#### Prologue Rule Changes

The Prologue will be conducted the same as the main season contest, with the following exceptions:

* Only a pilot's top two scores will contribute to their total score
* Only one winner will be crowned. Divisions will exist but not be used.
