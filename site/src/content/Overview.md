#### The NorCal Hike and Fly Contest aims to bring folks together for fun and friendly competition in the sport of hike and fly.  

Pilots submit hike and fly tracklogs, and scores are calculated from their tracks. At the end of the year, each pilot's top 4 scores are combined to give their season score. Winners will be announced in each category of EN-B, EN-C and EN-D classes. Prizes to be determined. Beer is likely to be involved.

Pilots are incentivized through scoring to join up and fly with others, but no formal events are planned.
