####  NorCal Hike and Fly Contest aims to bring folks together for friendly competition in the sport of hike and fly.  

The Contest is proposed for the season of 2026:

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
    Pilots submit and are scored on hike and fly tracklogs.   
    At the end of the year, each pilot's top 4 scores are combined to give their season score.  
    Winners will be announced in EN-B, EN-C and EN-D classes.  
    Prizes to be determined. Beer is likely to be involved.
</div>

Pilots are incentivized through scoring to join up and fly with others, but no formal events are planned.
